## About

### Description

**This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).**
TextMe is an android app designed for communication between user. The purpose of writing this project was to learn the development via PostgreSQL. ***You can download the APK file [here](https://portfolio-yeradil.vercel.app/)***.

### Tools
1. React Native: an open-source framework used for building native-style, cross-platform applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript.
2. Expo: a framework that makes developing Android and iOS apps easier. It is highly recommended for beginners to start.
3. TailwindCSS: a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable developers to create applications faster and more efficiently with smaller css files.
4. Supabase: an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform designed to simplify the development of web, mobile, and AI applications which was built on top of PostgreSQL and thus provides developers with a suite of tools to manage backend infrastructure effortlessly, making it a popular alternative to Firebase.

### Prerequisites
Make sure that the following tools are already installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): It is a JavaScript runtime build.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/): It is an open source version control system.
- [Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/): For debugging with physical a device or emulator. Please refer to the link for instructions.

### Get Started

1. Clone the Repository

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/w-obi/TextMe.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install

   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

6. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Get a Fresh Project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
